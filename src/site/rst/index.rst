Description
-----------

The information system (IS) **Cantharella: Pharmacochemical database of natural substances**, 
designed and developed by IRD, share and sustain pharmacochemical data of all organisms collected 
for the study of their natural substances, with a controlled access via the Internet.

The IS provides access to **harvest and taxonomic data**, monitor various chemical processes of 
extraction and purification, and finally centralize all **biological activities**.
The database is progressive according to the extraction and purification methods needed and the 
biological tests performed.

Features
--------

- **Collaborative** work between spatially disparate people
- **Secure access** and 'compartmentalized' according to data access rights
- **Traceability** of the chemical process leading to the active compounds
- **Capitalization** of data and related documents
